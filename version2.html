        <h2>about me</h2>

        <p>A Health Coach is a highly educated guide in the fields of nutrition, wellness, bio-individuality and mentoring, who
          supports clients to achieve their health goals through individualized food changes and lifestyle and behavior
          adjustments.</p>
        <p>As a Health Coach, I emphasize holistic health beyond the plate, I approach wellness through 12 primary areas of your
          life that impact your long-term health just as much as the food you eat (like your relationships, career,
          spirituality,
          and physical activity). I also focus on bio-individuality, the idea that we’re all different and have unique dietary,
          lifestyle, emotional, and physical needs. This means that I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to health
          and
          wellness. Instead, I work with clients to help them discover how to fuel their bodies and become the healthiest,
          happiest versions of themselves through a holistic approach.</p>
