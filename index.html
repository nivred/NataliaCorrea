            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A Health Coach is a highly educated guide in the fields of nutrition, wellness, bio-individuality
            and mentoring, who supports clients to achieve their health goals through individualized food
            changes and lifestyle and behavior adjustments.</p>
            
            <p>As a Health Coach, I emphasize holistic health beyond the plate, I approach wellness through 12
            primary areas of your life that impact your long-term health just as much as the food you eat (like
            your relationships, career, spirituality, and physical activity). I also focus on bio-individuality,
            the idea that we’re all different and have unique dietary, lifestyle, emotional, and physical needs.
            This means that I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to health and wellness. Instead, I
            work with clients to help them discover how to fuel their bodies and become the healthiest, happiest
            versions of themselves through a holistic approach.</p>
