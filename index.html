            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
              I’m Natalia Correa, a Holistic Health and Intuitive Eating Coach, dedicated to helping you end your
              fight with food and regain self-confidence by reconnecting with intuition and understanding your
              inner cues.
            </p>
            <p>
              But not too long ago I was struggling with controlling myself around food and loving my body.
              My biggest fear was to gain weight, my biggest goal was to shrink my body, and my biggest desire was
              to control my need for food (aka binging) and just feel normal.
            </p>
            <p>Sounds familiar?</p>
            <p>
              I spent so many years fighting against my hunger, wishing my relationship with food to be effortless
              and hoping that one day that a new diet would finally work for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              It wasn’t until I worked with, and was certified as, a Holistic Health & intuitive eating coach that
              I was finally able to achieve food freedom and feel at home in my own skin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning about integrative health and the psychology of emotional eating allowed me to understand
              why I was struggling with binge and emotional eating. This knowledge provided me with tools and
              resources to heal my relationship with food and nourish myself as a whole. I finally learned to
              listen to my body and take care of it from a place of love and compassion, instead of punishment and
              fear.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>A Health Coach is a highly educated guide in the fields of nutrition, wellness, bio-individuality
            and mentoring, who supports clients to achieve their health goals through individualized food
            changes and lifestyle and behavior adjustments.</p>
            
            <p>As a Health Coach, I emphasize holistic health beyond the plate, I approach wellness through 12
            primary areas of your life that impact your long-term health just as much as the food you eat (like
            your relationships, career, spirituality, and physical activity). I also focus on bio-individuality,
            the idea that we’re all different and have unique dietary, lifestyle, emotional, and physical needs.
            This means that I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to health and wellness. Instead, I
            work with clients to help them discover how to fuel their bodies and become the healthiest, happiest
            versions of themselves through a holistic approach.</p> -->

              It’s my mission to help you build the beautiful connection between you, your intuition, and your
              body. During our time together, I’ll provide you with tools, resources, and daily practices that
              will support you in your journey towards healing your relationship with food and your body.
            </p>
            <p>
              This path to self-discovery will allow you to re-evaluate the beliefs, rules, and ideas that you
              have about health and food. You’ll be able to let go of the things that aren’t supporting you and
              create new healthy boundaries that will nourish your mind, body and soul.

                        <q class="part">Natalia is a wonderful, empowering coach and for the past few months has been like a sister to me.
                        From the first session she helped me set attainable goals, moved me to let go of the self hatred,
                        and always allowed me the space to be kind to myself. She makes me happy because she listens and
                        understands. She's incredibly supportive and empathetic. Natalia meets you where you are because
                        she’s been there too. Identifying false beliefs that have created obstacles and shares insightful
                        knowledge that has opened my mind to what’s possible. By acknowledging what is really going on with
                        you, it's easier to see the light at the end of the tunnel. She has helped me find acceptance and
                        set me on the path towards self-love. Most of all I think what makes Natalia so special is her
                        authenticity.
