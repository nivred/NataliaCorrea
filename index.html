            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Natalia Correa, a Holistic Health and Intuitive Eating Coach dedicated to helping you end your
              fight with food and negative body image. As a certified Integrative Nutrition Coach my focus is on 
              holistic wellness using both bio-individuality and mentoring to support clients in their health goals. 
              But not too long ago, I was the one struggling around food and loving my body. My biggest 
              fear was to gain weight, my greatest goal was to shrink my body, and my strongest desire was to control 
              my need for food.</p>
            <p>Sound familiar?</p>
            <p>I spent so many years fighting against my hunger, wishing my relationship with food to be effortless
              and hoping that one day a new diet would finally work for me. It wasn’t until I worked with a coach,
              and received my own certification, that I was finally able to achieve food freedom and feel 
              at home in my own skin. Learning about integrative health and the psychology of emotional eating allowed 
              me to understand why I was struggling with binge and emotional eating. This knowledge provided me with 
              tools and resources to heal my relationship with food and nourish myself as a whole. I finally learned to
              listen to my body and take care of it from a place of love and compassion, instead of punishment and
              fear. Now I want to help others regain self-confidence, reconnect with their intuition, and 
              understand their inner cues.</p>

            <!-- <p>A Health Coach is a highly educated guide in the fields of nutrition, wellness, bio-individuality
            and mentoring, who supports clients to achieve their health goals through individualized food
            changes and lifestyle and behavior adjustments.</p>
            
            <p>As a Health Coach, I emphasize holistic health beyond the plate, I approach wellness through 12
            primary areas of your life that impact your long-term health just as much as the food you eat (like
            your relationships, career, spirituality, and physical activity). I also focus on bio-individuality,
            the idea that we’re all different and have unique dietary, lifestyle, emotional, and physical needs.
            This means that I don’t believe in a one-size-fits-all approach to health and wellness. Instead, I
            work with clients to help them discover how to fuel their bodies and become the healthiest, happiest
            versions of themselves through a holistic approach.</p> -->

              It’s my mission to help you build a beautiful connection between you, your intuition, and your
              body. During our time together, I’ll provide you with tools, resources, and daily practices that
              will support you in your journey towards healing your relationship with food and your body.
            </p>
            <p>
              This path to self-discovery will allow you to re-evaluate the beliefs, rules, and ideas you
              have about health and nutrition. You’ll be able to let go of the things that aren’t supporting you and
              create new healthy boundaries that will nourish your mind, body and soul.

                  <p>Taking the first step is a very important part of the healing process. Once you submit a request to join
                    my program and book your <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--text);">free 20-minute</span> Discovery Session, we'll have an opportunity to discuss your
                    struggles, goals, and level of commitment. I'll take the time to go over the different resources I can 
                    provide and answer any additional questions you may have. By the time we're done, we can decide if working
                    together will be a good fit.

                <div class="accordion-content hide">
                  <p>Intuitive Eating is a non-diet approach that helps you build a long-term, healthy relationship with
                  food. It guides you to identify and reconnect with your natural hunger and fullness cues. Intuitive Eating
                  puts you back in tune with your body's unique needs, instead of relying on outside influences that tell
                  you what, when, and how much to eat.</p>

                <label for="acc-faq-5" class="arrow">Can Intuitive Eating really help me?</label>
                <div class="accordion-content hide">

                  <p>The truth is, Intuitive Eating is for everyone, but it can make a huge difference for people who have 
                    an unhealthy relationship with food. However, by asking yourself the following questions you can help
                    decide the answer for yourself?</p>
                  <p>Do you obsess over your body size or the number you see on the scale? As a result, have you done things
                    like calorie count or track food, exercise to make up for what you eat, or eliminate entire food groups? 
                    How about feeling deprived, out of control, or ashamed? Do you end up binging when you're unable to hold
                    back cravings anymore? Do you think your self-worth depends on the way you look?</p>
                  <p>If you answered yes to any of these then it means it's time for a change. Intuitive Eating can make a
                    difference.</p>
